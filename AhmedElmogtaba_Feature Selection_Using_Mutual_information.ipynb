So our goal is to learn a model that only relies on ***k << d*** features.\n","\n","\n","\n","## **Why do we do feature selection ?**\n","Models that use only a small subset of features require a\n","smaller memory footprint and can be applied faster. Furthermore, in applications such as medical diagnostics, obtaining each possible “feature” (e.g., test result) can be costly; therefore, a model that uses only a small number of features is desirable even at the cost of a small degradation in performance, relative to a model that uses more features.\n","\n","\n","## **How do we do feature selection ?**\n","\n","Ideally, we could have tried all subsets of ***k*** out of ***d*** features and choose the subset which leads to the best performing model (using cross validation). However, such an exhaustive search is usually computationally intractable.\n","\n","\n","## **Feature selection methods:**\n","\n","Moustapha covered 3 computationally feasible approaches for feature selection: L1 Regularization, Wrapper (Greedy) Methods (Forward Search & Backward Elimination) and Filter Method. While these methods\n","cannot guarantee finding the optimal subset, they often work reasonably well in practice.\n","\n","## **Filter Method**\n","One of the simplest approach for feature selection is the filter method, in which we assess individual features, independently of other features, according to some quality measure. We can then select the ***k*** features that achieve the highest score (alternatively, we can decide on the number of features to select according to the value of their scores).\n","\n","Many quality measures for features have been proposed in the literature. We will use [Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information) between the feature and the target as our measure of feature quality. Mutual information between a pair of random variables ***X*** and ***Y*** is defined as:\n","\n","<img src='https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/4b37af4015d70867b9c50b9cf82e0fc3598b070c' />\n","\n","Mutual information (MI) between two random variables is a non-negative value, which measures the dependency between the variables. It is equal to zero if and only if two random variables are independent, and higher values mean higher dependency.\n","\n","Where D<sub>KL</sub> is the [Kullback Leibler Divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) which is a measure of how one probability distribution is different from another. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-oG0KTmEtR_d"},"source":["---\n","---\n","---\n","---\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ICe7NMjrtVtk"},"source":["## **Setup Code**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"kG32sMnmC28w","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615337075268,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":2648,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Elmogtaba Abdelmoniem Ali","photoUrl":"","userId":"18363754646491842037"}}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","from sklearn import linear_model\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, normalize\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_split, KFold \n","from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_regression"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9VncX6pntkd3"},"source":["---\n","---\n","---\n","---\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"-re9n3FugFiP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615337322646,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":245350,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed Elmogtaba Abdelmoniem Ali","photoUrl":"","userId":"18363754646491842037"}},"outputId":"69ac0504-a27e-4452-e462-3b47af6bbd79"},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G7lqZJ9LC28x"},"source":["## **Data** \n","\n","We will experiment **again** with cancer mortality rates dataset from [here](https://data.world/nrippner/ols-regression-challenge).
